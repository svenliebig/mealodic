# Meal Plans

Individual users or families can create different meal plans that show the user what they should eat on what day. A meal plan can have up to 3 meals per day, maybe more in the future.

## Creating

When creating a meal plan the user can give the meal plan a name and is forwarded to the meal plan UI. In the UI the user can add meals to the meal plan by dragging and dropping them into the calendar view. The user can also view the meals details by clicking on them, on go to the recipe view/edit view through the UI in the meal details.

## Meal Types

The meal plan can have different meal types, for example:

- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner

Depending on the time of the day the meal plan will have different meal types.

## Shopping Lists

When the user creates a shopping list from a meal plan, the application will generate a shopping list based on the ingredients of the meals in the meal plan. The shopping list will show the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients needed. The user can also edit the shopping list by adding or removing ingredients or changing the amount of the ingredients.

### Ignoring Ingredients

The user can ignore specific ingredients from shopping lists entirely by clicking on the ingredient and selecting the `Ignore` option. The ingredient will then be removed from the shopping list and future shopping lists will not include it. The user can see all it's ignored ingredients in the profile settings under Shopping List > Ignored Ingredients.
