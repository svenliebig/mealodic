# Meal Plans

Individual users or families can create different meal plans that show the user what they should eat on what day. A meal plan can have up to five meals per day, maybe more in the future. A meal plan contains seven days (weekly by default), the user can choose the starting week day of the meal plan. Meal plans are not tied to dates, they are only an abstract plan and the user decides on which date they implement it.

## Creating

When creating a meal plan the user can give the meal plan a name and is forwarded to the meal plan UI. In the UI the user can add meals to the meal plan by dragging and dropping them into the calendar view. The user can also view the meals details by clicking on them, on go to the recipe view/edit view through the UI in the meal details.

The user can choose the portions (servings) for each meal, the application will calculate the total amount of ingredients needed for the meal plan based on the servings and the ingredients in the recipes.

### Adding Meals (Recipes)

The user can add recipes from a recipe menu, the menu will show all recipes the user and family member have created as well as all favorites and custom lists the user created. The user can drag and drop the recipes into the calendar view.

## Meal Types

The meal plan can have different meal types, for example:

- Breakfast
- Morning Snack
- Lunch
- Afternoon Snack
- Dinner

Depending on the time of the day the meal plan will have different meal types.

## Missing Recipes

If recipes are referenced in the meal plan that got deleted by the author or by an admin, the meal plan will show a warning instead in place of the meal position and the user can choose to remove the recipe from the meal plan.

## Future

### Meal Plan Printing

The user can export the meal plan to a PDF file. The PDF file will contain the meal plan with the recipes. The PDF file will be a printable format that the user can use it to inform their family about the meal plan.
