# Ingredients

Ingredients can be created individually in the ingredients section or when creating a recipe and adding a new ingredient that the application doesn't know yet.

## Ingredient Types

Ingredients can have types, for example:

- 🥩 Meat
- 🐟 Fish
- 🥬 Vegetable
- 🍎 Fruit
- 🧂 Spice
- 🌿 Herb
- 🌾 Grain

The types are determined automatically be a local LLM. Not every ingredient has to have a type, for example a `Egg` would not have a type.

## Future

Ingredients should have nutritional information, so the application can calculate the calories, protein, carbohydrates, fat, etc. for the ingredient and the entire recipe later.
